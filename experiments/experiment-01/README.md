# Experiment 01

Remember what we want to do:

- Create a resource group named as you wish
- Within it create a VNet in the CIDR range you wish
- It should have a subnet
- And a Ubuntu VM inside it running Nginx
- To ensure you can access from your browser you will need to add a network security group to allow port 80 and attach it to the corresponding NIC or subnet (depending how you do the networking)

Try to reuse part of what you had from lab 8 and go form there!
